# Flashcards

My fourth project from Hyperskill.

The programs allows user to add cards with a pair of values (term - definition for example). Then it asks the first value of the random card to the user for a specified amount of times, expecting to receive the correct second value as input.

Supported actions: 
- add card;
- remove card;
- import cards and mistake counts to a text file;
- export from and mistake counts from a text file;
- ask the cards for a specified amount of times;
- creating a text log file (inputs and outputs of the program);
- showing the hardest card (with most mistakes made while being answered);
- reseting the statistics (mistake counts);
- console parameters available: -import *filename* -export *filename*.
